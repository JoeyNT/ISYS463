<h2 align="left">Executive Summary</h2>
<h3 align="left">Introduction</h3>
Resources are the backbone of any economy; they are essential to innovation and consumerism. As the need for resources remains exponential, its supply decreases. This issue requires companies to change how they receive and utilize resources. That’s where ENVO steps in, an upcycling company that recycles raw materials from old shoes, transforming them into new, environmentally friendly footwear. Our services include donation centers, charitable donations, recycling, waste management, and services that allow ENVO to create the product. As the company gains its foothold within the industry, ENVO can branch into various other markets; With ENVO’s gathered footwear materials proving highly versatile.<br>
<h3 align="left">Market Overview </h3>

As society is realizing the repercussions of time on this planet, people are transitioning to a more environmentally friendly economy. Cars are switching to electricity, power is being drawn from hydro and solar, and even take-out bags are all eco-friendly. With changes like this in mind, the industry is primed for ENVO to transition the shoe market to an environmentally friendly model. Our main competitor is Allbirds, which specializes in manufacturing eco-friendly wool shoes. However, they have no recycling model and their price point remains 35% higher than the average price of a pair of shoes. Our model allows us to minimize costs in raw materials resulting in a lower price point along with higher profit margins.<br>

<h3 align="left">Plan</h3>

ENVO plans to receive raw materials through donations and partnerships with waste management companies to keep costs low and have direct access to any materials needed. Along with that a consumer service in which customers can donate their shoes and receive a tax write-off or credit towards purchasing a shoe with ENVO. Being an environmentally friendly company, ENVO plans to give back to the world. Thus, partnerships with various charities and foundations will receive a certain percentage of profits to truly bring about change.<br>

<h2 align="left">Introduction</h2>
The world and its resources are finite, yet the need for growth and innovation remains exponential. Admirable, yet needs come with consequences. Each year in America, 300 million pairs of shoes are wasted, taking an average of 30 to 40 years for just one pair to decompose; Resulting in overfilled landfills and waste of precious finite resources. ENVO seeks to solve this problem. 

At ENVO, the company takes shoes that are being donated and are destroyed and repurposes/recycles them to create new and affordable shoes; Reducing millions of pounds of waste per year, resulting in a cleaner and ENVO planet.

<h2 align="left">Market Analysis</h2>
ENVO is an upcycling shoe brand dedicated to eco-friendliness. The company takes footwear donations from customers and transforms them into affordable, everyday sneakers. The company offers socially-conscious consumers peace of mind knowing their purchase not only prevents excess waste but to charities committed to saving the planet. 

At the start of 2020, the COVID-19 lockdown severely harmed economic activity, projected to be "much worse than during the 2008–09 financial crisis," with the shoe industry experiencing a rapid decrease in sales. Fortunately, footwear is proving to be a lucrative business once more, but that victory has come at a price. Consumer behavior has changed, and while established shoe companies scramble to adjust to a new market, emerging brands (Like ENVO) have a golden opportunity to enter the market. 

ENVO will be entering a world of high competition, with mature brands such as Nike, Puma, and Adidas dominating the everyday sneaker industry. Nonetheless, these big-name companies' main priority is streetwear design, unlike ENVO. ENVO values its environmental roots, focusing on sustainability.

Sustainable footwear is rising in popularity, with "79% of consumers changing their purchase preferences based on social responsibility, inclusiveness, or environmental impact." ENVO is committed to reducing waste and protecting the earth, perfectly fitting the preferences of environmentally-aware customers.  

ENVO plans to solve this harmful process; By transforming any old pair of footwear into something new again only then, can this constant cycle of waste be broken. 

<h2 align="left">The Problem</h2>
With global warming getting worse, only around ~15% of textile waste is recycled or reused in the United States; Although almost everything in all households can be repurposed. Donating textile items to ENVO  gives streetwear a new purpose in life while saving the world.
